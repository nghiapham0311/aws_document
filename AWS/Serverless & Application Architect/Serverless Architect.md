#### What is serverless
- Serverless **isn't one single thing**.
- You manage *few, if any* servers - low overhead.
- Application are a collection of small & specialized functions
- ... **Stateless** and **Ephemeral** environments - duration billing.
- Everything **Event-driven** .. consumption only when being used.
- **FaaS** is used where possible for compute functionality.
- **Managed services** are used where possible.
