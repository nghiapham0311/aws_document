- CAP Theorem - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerant (resilience) - **Choose only 2**.
- <font color="#9bbb59">ACID</font> = Consistency.
- <font color="#4f81bd">BASE</font> = Availability.

Dynamo DB is the example for BASE
It offers both eventually and immediately consistent reads.
It highly scalable.
## Exam Powerup
- **BASE mention** - NoSQL, DynamoDB
- **ACID mention** - SQL, RDS
- **NoSQL mention alongside with ACID** - DynamoDB with transaction
