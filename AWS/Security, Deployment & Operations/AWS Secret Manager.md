Sometime get confuse with Parameter Store.
#### Fundamentals
- It does *share functionality* with Parameter Store.
- Designed for **secrets** (password, API key,...).
- Usable from the *console*, *CLI*, *API* or *SDK's* (integration).
- Support **automatic rotation** .... this uses **lambda**.
- Directly integrates with *some AWS product* (...RDS).
- Using *IAM Role* to control access to AWS Secret Manager.

Exam mention rotation secret then it AWS Secret Manager

If you see any question mention anything secret, rotation, mention RDS -> It's the AWS Secret Manager is the correct answer.
